    <p>In these Terms, “we”, “our”, “us”, and “MEDVi” collectively refer to MEDVi and any products, subsidiaries, and affiliations. The terms “you” and “yours” refer to the person using the Platform. Use of the Platform is governed by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. By accessing or using the Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be legally bound by and comply with these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>Even though you may have arrived at the Platform through a website operated or controlled by a third party, including by an affiliate of MEDVi, you understand and agree that these Terms are entered into between you and MEDVi. You also understand and agree that the Platform and any services provided through these Terms, except the Healthcare Services described herein, are provided by MEDVi.</p>

    <p>You agree that when you use or enter the Platform, you affirmatively consent to conduct business electronically with MEDVi and engage in health-oriented activities with health professionals and professional entities affiliated with MEDVi, and such processes have the same force and effect as your written signature. You agree and consent to MEDVi and certain affiliated professional entities sending you disclosures, messages, notices, and other communications to your designated mobile phone and email account. If you do not agree with any of these Terms or our Privacy Policy, you may not use the Platform.</p>

    <p>This agreement is subject to changes as explained below.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to amend these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, without penalty or liability to you or any third-party. You should check the Terms from time to time when you use the Platform to determine if any changes have been made.

    <h2>III. Description of MEDVi</h2>

    <p>You understand that the Platform gathers unique information from you to enable an affiliated medical provider through the Healthcare Services to determine whether a prescription or a diagnostic test is indicated and appropriate for you, including applicable health information (such as your past and present health conditions, medications, and blood pressure), diagnostic tests, as applicable, and personal information (such as your name, location and demographic information) (collectively, “Your Information”). You further understand and agree that after reviewing Your Information, the medical provider, in his or her independent professional judgment, will determine whether to prescribe you medication, other treatment, or, alternatively, recommend that you consult with alternative clinical resources (the “Healthcare Services”).</p>

    <p>You give us consent to send and disclose to the affiliated professional entities and their medical providers all of Your Information so that you may be assessed and possibly receive Healthcare Services.</p>

    <p>Further, you consent to our delivery of Your Information to MEDVi affiliated and unaffiliated pharmacies, laboratories, and other diagnostic testing companies as part of coordinating desired fulfillment and payment for diagnostic testing, prescription medications, and medical devices recommended as part of the Healthcare Services.</p>

    <p>All medical providers who deliver Healthcare Services through the Platform are: (i) independent professionals contracted or employed with affiliated professional entities that coordinate with MEDVi and (ii) solely responsible for such Healthcare Services provided to you.</p>

    <p>By accepting this Agreement, you additionally understand and agree that MEDVi is not acting as a pharmacy, nor do we control or interfere with any such services.

    <h2>X. Disclaimer of Limited Healthcare Services</h2>

    <p>The Platform is structured for use specific to certain health care services and is not, and should not, be considered, or used as comprehensive medical advice, care, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>

    <p>Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding general personal health, medical conditions, or drugs or medications, and before commencing or discontinuing any course of treatment, drug, or medication.</p>

    <h2>XI. Telehealth Consent</h2>

    <p>Telehealth uses electronic communications, information technology, and other means to connect patients in one location and licensed, certified, or registered healthcare professionals in another location regarding a clinical matter. Though Telehealth carries potential benefits, like any medical procedure, it also carries potential risks. Please review the full Telehealth Informed Consent which informs you about the treatment methods, risks, and limitations of utilizing Telehealth to meet your health and wellness needs. In order to receive Health Care Services, you will be required to agree to the Telehealth Informed Consent regarding the use of Telehealth.</p>

    <h2>XII. Payment</h2>

    <p>When you submit Your Information for Health Care Services, you agree to pay all fees due.

If you receive a medical consultation, medical consult fees are not subject to or eligible for a refund. We cannot accept returns of prescription products for reuse or resale, and all sales are final. If you believe we have made an error please message us through your MEDVi portal.</p>

    <p>You understand and agree that you are responsible for all fees due to receive the Services, including any fees charged by medical providers and affiliated medical professional entities.

Please be informed that we gather essential payment data, encompassing your payment instrument particulars (such as credit card number) and associated security code, solely for the purpose of facilitating payment processing. It is imperative to note that all payment information is meticulously safeguarded within the secure infrastructure provided by Stripe. For a comprehensive understanding of data privacy practices, we encourage you to peruse the privacy notice available at: <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">https://stripe.com/privacy</a>.</p>

    <p>You understand that MEDVi-affiliated medical professional entities are not contracted healthcare providers with any health insurance plans (commercial, government, or otherwise, i.e., “out-of-network” providers), and therefore, you understand and agree that you are exclusively and solely responsible for paying all fees due to receive the Healthcare Services provided to you, including any fees charged by the medical providers and affiliated medical professional entities. Amounts collected by MEDVi will include fees charged by medical providers for Healthcare Services. In the event that your credit card expires or MEDVi, our affiliates, or our third-party payment processors are unable to process your payment, you may receive notice for you to provide an alternative payment method. MEDVi and/or the medical provider(s) have no obligation to provide any Healthcare Services unless and until full payment has been received and/or verified.</p>

    <p>You also understand and agree that, because MEDVi medical providers are not contracted with any health insurance plan to provide the Healthcare Services, including federal or state government health care programs, like Medicaid and Medicare, any prescription medication or laboratory service ordered by a MEDVi medical provider may also not be covered.</p>

    <p>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US (INCLUDING DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY), WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS, AS WELL AS CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, ARE NOT PERMITTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THAT YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.</p>

    <p>You and we each agree that you and we are further waiving our respective rights to sue or go to court to assert or defend our rights under this User Agreement. You and we each agree that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.</p>

    <p>Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other MEDVi users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.</p>

    <p>Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</p>

    <p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your MEDVi account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them to:</p>

    <p>MEDVi, LLC<br/>
    131 Continental Dr, Ste 305<br/>
    Newark, DE 19713<br/>
    <a href="mailto:help@medvi.org">help@medvi.org</a></p>

    <p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your MEDVi account, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek.</p>

    <p>Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to:</p>

    <p>MEDVi, LLC<br/>
    131 Continental Dr, Ste 305<br/>
    Newark, DE 19713<br/>
    <a href="mailto:help@medvi.org">help@medvi.org</a></p>

    <p>Before arbitration commences, we will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your MEDVi account, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</p>

    <p>The costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>

    <p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for Delaware, or a state court located in New Castle County, Delaware. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.</p>

    <p>The laws of the State of Delaware, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>XXIII. Miscellaneous</h2>

    <p>The Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter herein. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect. Headings are for reference only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. Our failure to act with respect to any failure by you or others to comply with these Terms does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar failures.
