<p>The Platform may utilize &quot;cookies&quot; to improve the functionality of the Platform. Cookies are text files that are sent by servers to web browsers and stored on your computer.

We can then develop statistics that help us understand how our visitors use our websites and how to improve them. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Platform; provided, however, that MEDVi disclaims, and you hereby waive, any claim or liability that may arise due to your partial or incomplete access to the content of any of the Platform as a result thereof. Visitors also can utilize the Global Privacy Control (&quot;GPC&quot;) add-on or browser preference, which signals that you do not want personal information collected by websites you visit. Our Sites are designed to respond to GPC signals.</p>
