<h1>Notice of Privacy Practices</h1>

<p>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</p>

<h2>I. Who We Are</h2>

<p>This Notice of Privacy Practices (“Notice”) describes the privacy practices of MEDVi, LLC and its affiliates, including certain affiliated professional entities, their physicians, health care practitioners, and other personnel (“we” or “us”).</p>

<h2>II. Our Privacy Obligations</h2>

<p>We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health information (“Protected Health Information” or “PHI”) and to provide you with this Notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your PHI. We are also obligated to notify you following a Breach of unsecured PHI. When we use or disclose your PHI, we are required to abide by the terms of this Notice (or other notice in effect at the time of the use or disclosure).</p>

<h2>III. Permissible Uses and Disclosures Without Your Written Authorization</h2>

<p>In certain situations, which we describe in Section IV below, we must obtain your written authorization in order to use and/or disclose your PHI. We do not need any type of authorization, however, for the following uses and disclosures:</p>

<h3>A. Uses and Disclosures For Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations.</h3>
<p>We may use and disclose PHI, but not your “Highly Confidential Information” (defined in Section IV.B below), in order to treat you, obtain payment for services provided to you, and conduct our “Healthcare Operations” as detailed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Treatment.</strong> We may use and disclose your PHI to provide treatment, for example, to diagnose and treat your injury or illness. We may also disclose PHI to other health care providers involved in your treatment.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment.</strong> In most cases, we may use and disclose your PHI to obtain payment for services that we provide to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthcare Operations.</strong> We may use and disclose your PHI for our healthcare operations which include internal administration and planning and various activities that improve the quality and cost effectiveness of the care that we deliver to you. For example, we may use PHI to evaluate the quality and competence of our physicians and other health care practitioners. We may also disclose PHI in order to resolve any complaints you may have. We may also disclose PHI to your other healthcare providers when such PHI is required for them to treat you, receive payment for services they render to you, or conduct certain healthcare operations, such as quality assessment and improvement activities, reviewing the quality and competence of healthcare professionals, or for health care fraud and abuse detection or compliance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>B. Disclosure to Relatives, Close Friends and Other Caregivers.</h3>

<p>If you are not present, or the opportunity to agree or object to a use or disclosure cannot practicably be provided because of your incapacity or an emergency circumstance, we may exercise our professional judgment to determine whether a disclosure is in your best interests. If we disclose information to a family member, other relative or a close personal friend, we would disclose only information that we believe is directly relevant to the person’s involvement with your health care or payment related to your health care. We may also disclose your PHI in order to notify (or assist in notifying) such persons of your location, general condition, or death.</p>
